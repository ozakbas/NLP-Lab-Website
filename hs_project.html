    <h1>Hate Speech Detection</h1>

    <p><span style="color: #003366"><b>Project Aim:&nbsp;</b></span><b>To build a machine learning
            system that can detect hate-speech in social media</b></p>
    <p>In recent years, disseminating hate speech around the world has increased significantly. To
        counter this ever-growing threat to society, many automated systems to detect hate speech in
        social media have been recently proposed by the research community.&nbsp;This project aims to
        develop hate speech detection systems in Turkish and Arabic separately, taking into account the
        specificity and richness of the morphological structure inherent in each language. Language
        resources such as labeled corpora and lexicon will be developed specifically for hate speech
        detection; and shared with other researchers.<b> </b></p>
    <p>There is a continuum of hate-speech, from negative stereotyping to aggravated hate speech. In
        order to understand and obtain data to train a machine learning system that automatically
        categorize tweets, we started labelling tweets with hashtag <span
